WHAT IS IP CHECKER/TRACKER?
An IP tracker is a tool or software used to identify and track the geographical location and other details of an IP address. It allows users to obtain information such as the country, city, ISP (Internet Service Provider), and sometimes even the specific region or network the IP address is connected to. IP trackers can be useful for various purposes, such as network troubleshooting, analyzing website traffic, or determining the origin of a particular internet user or device.
